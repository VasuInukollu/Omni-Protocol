# Recording implementation handover

- Repository/default checkout: /Users/vasu/Dev/Personal/Omni-Protocol
- Dedicated worktree: /Users/vasu/Dev/Personal/Omni-Protocol/.worktrees/task-recording
- Branch: feat/task-recording (fork origin)
- Implementation commit: 36aa34d1cce3d1126860164d86c2deaea106d2d1
- PR: https://github.com/Inukollu/Omni-Protocol/pull/106
- Completed: per-task independent provider/host recording permissions and current evidence; start/pause/resume/stop/cancel commands; explicit cancel disposition; source routing, allocation/recording/observation guards, expiry and outcome validation; host declaration/report and conformance harness support; guide/migration.
- Validation: full pnpm check passed on 2026-09-09: build, typecheck, 380 tests, guide examples, package verification (10 artifacts). No live tests.
- Compatibility: protocol 2; version-1-only peers refused explicitly. Package version unchanged at 0.1.80; no package release performed.
- Remaining integration: host/provider recorder implementations, actual storage/capture, trusted observation clocks and atomic executor/idempotency guarantees. This repository defines and validates the contract, not those implementations. Historical recording ledger remains separate.
- Outcome: PR106 MERGED at 2026-09-09T18:14:33Z, merge commit 92fca9f9bca9809677839ea6179a9d12384dae7a.
- Cleanup gate: independently verified merged/intentionally closed, clean worktree, needed commits retained remotely and terminal outcome recorded. Remote branch deletion requires separate instruction.
- Runtime files live under the dedicated worktree's .agent-memory/runtime. Default checkout receives the same monitor handover; monitor writes are intentional notes, not source changes.

## Terminal verification and cleanup

- Independent forge verification: MERGED; PR head 66a3f36f22f7f3669aa83665de0b2edf5ec6493c.
- Pre-merge Node 20 guide compiler test exceeded its 5000ms timeout; Node 22/24 passed. Attempt to rerun required repository admin rights.
- Post-merge CI succeeded: https://github.com/Inukollu/Omni-Protocol/actions/runs/34387809469 (including Node 20). This supersedes the transient pre-merge timeout for merged-code validation.
- Publish workflow succeeded: https://github.com/Inukollu/Omni-Protocol/actions/runs/34387809610. Upstream package bump commit 62cff5f records version 0.1.81; no manual release by this worker.
- Monitor omni-protocol-pr106-recording recorded MERGED at 2026-09-09T18:14:39.766202+00:00 and exited; PID 72707 independently verified absent.
- Both implementation/PR-head commits are retained in upstream/main and origin/feat/task-recording. This terminal notes commit must also be pushed to that fork ref before local deletion.
- Cleanup authorized only after notes commit is remote-reachable and tracked tree is clean: remove the stopped monitor's explicit runtime directory, dedicated task-recording worktree and corresponding local feat/task-recording branch. Retain remote branch. Default checkout retains this terminal handover.
- Remaining product integration: host/provider recorder implementations; no recording-history ledger implementation implied.
